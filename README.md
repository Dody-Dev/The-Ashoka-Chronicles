**Instructions with Specific Requirements:**

1. **Main Blog Title:**  
   - Use an `<h1>` tag for the main blog title: "The Ashoka Chronicles."

2. **Subheadings:**  
   Create the following sub-sections under the main title, each with a specific focus, and use `<h2>` tags for these subheadings:
   
   - **"Early Life of Ashoka"**  
     Describe Ashoka’s family background, education, and rise to power.
     
   - **"The Battle of Kalinga"**  
     Cover the causes, major events, and outcomes of the Battle of Kalinga, emphasizing its impact on Ashoka.
     
   - **"Ashoka’s Embrace of Buddhism"**  
     Discuss how the battle influenced Ashoka's decision to adopt Buddhism, including the reforms he introduced afterward.

3. **Content Body:**  
   Write brief paragraphs under each subheading:
   
   - **For "Early Life of Ashoka":**  
     Provide two paragraphs: one on Ashoka’s family background and education, and another on his early political ambitions.

4. **Code Snippet (Edict)**

   “All men are my children, and just as I desire for my own children that they should be provided with all kinds of welfare and happiness in this world and the next, the same do I desire for all men.”

5. **Separators (Horizontal Rules):**  
   Place `<hr>` tags between each of the three sub-sections to improve readability and visually separate content.
